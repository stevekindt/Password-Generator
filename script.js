// Use confirm (Y/N) or prompt (if necessary) to allow user to choose character types //
// Ensure that at least one character type is chosen with a check (if/else where else is null?) and alert user to select at least one type //
// List selectable characters in a string or array? //
// Maybe password output is defaulted to "Your Secure Password" as text and it's replaced with the password generated upon event? Need to use preventDefault in that case? //
